    <p class="section-paragraph">Working at Volvo involves high workload which involves among other factors stress, physical strain, high
        noise levels and high variety of heat. All of these aspects could affect workers health. A big challenge for
        Volvo is for the workers to actually use the safety-clothing at hand, as these are too warm and the
        workers would rather put themselves at risk when using welders instead of using protective gear.
        To prevent users from getting too warm when welding a set of adaptive clothing could be helpful. By
        making the clothing a part of a smart environment the temperature could be adjusted according to the
        user in a specific situation and thereafter learn patterns of when and where the user usually gets
        “overheated”.
    </p>
    <h2 class="section-subtitle">Aim and research questions</h2>
    <p class="section-paragraph">The aim of this project is to create a smart environment that adapts the worker's temperature depending
      on situation.
      </br>● When exposed to heat or getting too warm, how can cooling be applied on the user?
      </br>● What are the relevant aspects of the environment?
      </br>● How do we know when temperature adjustment is necessary and noninvasive?
    </p>
    <h2 id="methods" class="section-subtitle offset">Methods</h2>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
      During the project the design method used will be linear, due to the lack of time. A concept will be
      produced, and if enough time, a prototype will be made.
      The occupational therapy students(OT students) will be involved during the design process, offering
      valuable input in the concept. Since the OT students have some contact with Volvo some input will be
      given from the workers.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-subsubtitle">Use Scenario</h3>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
      A worker is grabbing the welder, which triggers the cooling equipment both by the grabbing of the welder
      and by the position of the worker. When the worker is welding the body temperature is rising and this also
      triggers the equipment and is cooling the person down. Now the worker is getting too cold so the person
      is adjusting the temperature which the equipment is acknowledging in its learning for this specific worker.
      When the worker moves on to another task the equipment adjusts the temperature according to the outer
      body temperature, the task and what it knows about the workers different patterns.

    <h3 id="intelligence" class="section-subsubtitle offset">Intelligence behind the system</h3>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
      The system has several inputs and one main output,
      adjustment of warmth of workers at Volvo. There are two viable options for reading and interpreting these inputs,
      either by using a decision tree or using a neural network.
      This system will focus on using the latter and why will be explained in the following paragraphs.
    </p>
    <h4 class="section-subsubsubtitle">Why neural network and not decision tree?</h4>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
      A neural network has a larger possibility for customizing the system to each unique
      individual whom uses it without having to account for each possible solution beforehand.
      A decision tree has the limitation that each given state must be assigned beforehand,
      for example “if welder is on apply cooling”. Therefore, a neural network is used when you
      want the system to design its own states depending on the actions of the user.
    </p>
    <h4 class="section-subsubsubtitle">Design of the neural network</h4>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
      A neural network is built up by input, nodes and outputs.
      These inputs are binary and represent a sensor or action,
      nodes are the computational units of the neural network and the output
      are the result of the computations. These form the three layers of our
      ANN (Artificial neural network) and they are connected through links(edges)
      with different strengths/weights to represent the bond of each input towards
      a specific outcome.
    </p>
    <strong>Input</strong></br>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
    In the system we have several inputs that
    make up the first layer of the neural network, which is the temperature
    of the user, location, welder information such as if the welder is on/off
    and how long the user have been welding.
    </p>
    <strong>Nodes</strong></br>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
    Nodes make up the second and most important layer of the neural network,
    the computational part of the network. They are responsible for calculating
    the total weight of all inputs and send this through an activation function.
    The activation function returns a representation of the likelihood for a
    specific output.
    </p>
    <img src="images/Activation.PNG" width="50%" /></br>
    <strong>Output</strong></br>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
      The final layer of the neural network which will indicate an action to be taken,
      which can be one of the following: increase/decrease warmth & do nothing.
    </p>
    <strong>Perceptron training</strong></br>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
      Perceptron training is the core functionality of a neural network,
      this is the part where all the weights of the neural network are adjusted
      according to the outputs. If a user is being cooled down when it’s not supposed
      to the network should adjust accordingly to prevent this from happening in the future.
      This is the largest struggle of a system of this scale, how do we train the weights in the
      beginning so that the user doesn’t get affected in a negative way and stops using the equipment all together.
      This is where the user input from the welding helmet and controls for the cooling
      system comes in handy. In the beginning the system will work as a thermostat, only
      change the heating when receiving user input. When a user gets cold he/she tells the system to heat up,
      the neural network saves the state and turns up the heat. After recording data from the users input the system can
      start to predict when to adjust the temperature and when to stay idle. After each
      prediction the neural network waits for the user to respond, if the user responds by
      changing the temperature a negative result is returned to the neural network and the
      weights are adjusted accordingly. For example: The system predicts that the user is
      going to get warm and starts a cooling process, the user responds by turning up the heat.
      The neural network changes the weights responsible for these false actions, i.e. the weights
      for “do nothing” and “apply heat” are increased and the “cool down” weights are decreased.
    </p>
    <img src="images/neuralnetwork.jpg" width="50%"/></br>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
      Each input to the neural network is to be accounted for as a perceptron, we'll discussion
      each perceptron and their main purpose in the section that follows.</br></br>
      <strong>Welder status</strong></br>Is the indication if and when the user is activly
      using the welder. An important indication of plausible overheating.</br></br>
      <strong>Total welding time</strong></br>Indicates how long the user has been
      welding, each timestep should increase the possibility of cooling the user down.</br></br>
      <strong>Body Temperature</strong></br>Sensor picking up the outer body temperature.</br></br>
      <strong>Surrounding Temperature</strong></br>Indication on the room Temperature
      used as a reference, for example during the summer this indication is of
      high value.</br></br>
      <strong>Location</strong></br>If the user is at the welding station or if
      he/she is idle on a coffebreak should be accounted for.</br></br>
      <strong>Time of day</strong></br>Time of day might affect the situational
      heating of the person using the equipment.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-subsubtitle">Requirements</h3>
    <p class="section-paragraph">● The user should have the possibility to adjust the amount of cooling
    </br>● The system should learn how the user is performing its task, creating autonomous cooling
    </br>● The wristband should be comfortable and nonivasive
    </br>● The wristband should not obstruct the worker performing his or hers tasks</p>
    <h3 class="section-subsubtitle">Material</h3>
    <p class="section-paragraph">Itemised lists:
      </br>● Thermoelectric generator. Needed for prototype to induce cooling to the users wrist
      </br>● Temperature sensor. Indication of skin temperature of user
      </br>● Location sensor: To invoke specific methods at different locations.
      </br>● Regulator To regulate the input voltage of the the thermoelectric generator.
      </br>● Softlab: To be able to create a wearable containing the thermoelectric generator and its sensors.
      </br>● Tutoring: We desperately need help assembling the electronic components.

    <h3 id="timeplan" class="section-subsubtitle offset">Time Plan</h3>

    </p>
    <h3 class="section-subsubtitle">Ethical Considerations</h3>
    <p>
      Since the device will record some data from the user some considerations is necessary. The recorded
      data should not be accessible by anyone, apart from the system itself. The system is not supposed to
      monitor how the workers are performing their task. The problem lies within convincing the users that their
      data is not being used to monitor them.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-subsubtitle">Expected result and/or considerations</h3>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
      The expected result is a wearable which helps the worker cool down during its physical tasks. The
      concept is a device which adapts to a specific user(not enough time to implement during the course).

      <p>
        Our prototype is a "Proof of concept" where we induct cooling upon the users
        by regulating the voltage to a thermal generator. This is soley used for
        enhancing our concept, when we present we will use it as means of
        showing that it is possible to cool down with rather simple means.
      </p>

    <h1 id="Discussion" class="section-title">Discussion</h1>
      <p class="section-paragraph">

  Regarding the work flow, we all agree that it has gone well.
  We are pleased with the collaboration with the OT students. Since the start of the project we
  have had an open discussion, where everyone has had the opportunity to be heard. The meetings
   have been efficient and fruitful. Though we are satisfied with the collaboration, we felt
   that we were thrown into a project which was already halfway finished. Resulting in us arriving
   to a kick-off and briefing completely unprepared.

  As mentioned above, the prototype was made in SoftLab. The assistance we received there was
  very useful, and we managed to produce a good enough prototype in a short amount of time.
  Because of the lack of time in the project, the development of the prototype has suffered.
   However, we are satisfied with the result.

  Regarding improvements of the projects, user integration has not been considered to the extent
   we would like. From the collected data we were given by the OT students, we have developed a
    concept which addresses the main problem for the workers as well as the goals of the course.
    Once again, the lack of time has been the primary reason why no user testing has been made.

  In conclusion, we believe the developed concept will improve the work environment.
  There are some technical barriers to overcome, which might be challenging, but not at all impossible.
