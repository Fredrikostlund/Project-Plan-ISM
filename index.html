    <h2 class="section-subtitle">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="section-paragraph">Working at Volvo involves high workload which involves among other factors stress, physical strain, high
        noise levels and high variety of heat. All of these aspects could affect workers health. A big challenge for
        Volvo is for the workers to actually use the safety-clothing at hand, as these are too warm and the
        workers would rather put themselves at risk when using welders instead of using protective gear.
        To prevent users from getting too warm when welding a set of adaptive clothing could be helpful. By
        making the clothing a part of a smart environment the temperature could be adjusted according to the
        user in a specific situation and thereafter learn patterns of when and where the user usually gets
        “overheated”.
    </p>
    <h2 class="section-subtitle">Aim and research questions</h2>
    <p class="section-paragraph">The aim of this project is to create a smart environment that adapts the worker's temperature depending
      on situation.
      </br>● When exposed to heat or getting too warm, how can cooling be applied on the user?
      </br>● What are the relevant aspects of the environment?
      </br>● How do we know when temperature adjustment is necessary and noninvasive?
    </p>
    <h2 class="section-subtitle">Methods</h2>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
      During the project the design method used will be linear, due to the lack of time. A concept will be
      produced, and if enough time, a prototype will be made.
      The occupational therapy students(OT students) will be involved during the design process, offering
      valuable input in the concept. Since the OT students have some contact with Volvo some input will be
      given from the workers.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-subsubtitle">Use Scenario</h3>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
      A worker is grabbing the welder, which triggers the cooling equipment both by the grabbing of the welder
      and by the position of the worker. When the worker is welding the body temperature is rising and this also
      triggers the equipment and is cooling the person down. Now the worker is getting too cold so the person
      is adjusting the temperature which the equipment is acknowledging in its learning for this specific worker.
      When the worker moves on to another task the equipment adjusts the temperature according to the outer
      body temperature, the task and what it knows about the workers different patterns.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-subsubtitle">Anticipated Design Solution that will be Demonstrated January 9-10</h3>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
       ● A prototype the simulate the function of the equipment.
      </br>  ● A visual demonstration of the system and how it is learning behaviours and adjusting the
        temperature.
      </br>● Posters with information about the product.</p>
    <h3 class="section-subsubtitle">Requirements</h3>
    <p class="section-paragraph">● The user should have the possibility to adjust the amount of cooling
    </br>● The system should learn how the user is performing its task, creating autonomous cooling
    </br>● The wristband should be comfortable and nonivasive
    </br>● The wristband should not obstruct the worker performing his or hers tasks</p>
    <h3 class="section-subsubtitle">Material</h3>
    <p class="section-paragraph">Itemised lists:
      </br>● Thermoelectric generator. Needed for prototype to induce cooling to the users wrist
      </br>● Temperature sensor. Indication of skin temperature of user
      </br>● Location sensor: To invoke specific methods at different locations.
      </br>● Regulator To regulate the input voltage of the the thermoelectric generator.
      </br>● Softlab: To be able to create a wearable containing the thermoelectric generator and its sensors.
      </br>● Tutoring: We desperately need help assembling the electronic components.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-subsubtitle">Time Plan</h3>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
      <b>Table​ ​1:</b>​Project divided into weekly segments

    </p>
    <h3 class="section-subsubtitle">Ethical Considerations</h3>
    <p>
      Since the device will record some data from the user some considerations is necessary. The recorded
      data should not be accessible by anyone, apart from the system itself. The system is not supposed to
      monitor how the workers are performing their task. The problem lies within convincing the users that their
      data is not being used to monitor them.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-subsubtitle">Expected result and/or considerations</h3>
    <p class="section-paragraph">
      The expected result is a wearable which helps the worker cool down during its physical tasks. The
      concept is a device which adapts to a specific user(not enough time to implement during the course).
